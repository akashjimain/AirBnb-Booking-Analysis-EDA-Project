#  Exploratory Data Analysis of NYC Airbnb Dataset, 2019

Airbnb connects people who need a place to stay with those who have a place to rent. Different variables play a large role in determining the price of a location. It is the host's responsibility to list a fair price for their accommodations. Those seeking lodging assess listings based on a variety of characteristics, including size, location, amenities, and—most importantly—price. This dataset describes the listing activity and metrics of NYC Airbnb in 2019. It contains all the information needed to make forecasts and draw inferences about NYC hosts, costs, and geographical accessibility. Our data, which consists of 48,895 rows and 16 columns. Primarily, it contains information about the name of the listing along with its latitude and longitude, the name of the listing's host, the room type, the price in dollars, the minimum number of nights spent here, the number of reviews, and the number of days available.

To work on data, we will be using different tools that are very common for performing simple and complex analyses, like classifications of variables, histograms, textual mining, and measures of central tendency.
For this project we are analyzing Airbnb’s New York City(NYC) data of 2019. NYC is not only the most famous city in the world but also top global destination for visitors drawn to its museums, entertainment, restaurants and commerce. According to the Office of New York State Comptroller, NYC hosted 66.6 million visitors in 2019.

Data analysis on thousands of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. Our main objective is to find out the key metrics that influence the listing of properties on the platform. For this, we will explore and visualize the dataset from Airbnb in NYC using basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. We have found out the distribution of every Airbnb listing based on their location, including their price range, room type, listing name, and other related factors. We have analyzed this dataset from different angles and have come up with interesting insights. This can help in making strategic data-driven decisions by the marketing team, finance team and technical team of Airbnb.
